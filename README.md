# Titanic-Survival-Prediction---Kaggle-Project
 Project Goal The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.   We use the **Kaggle Titanic dataset**, train models on the training set, and generate predictions for the test set.
